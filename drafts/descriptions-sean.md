# Garbage Collector

Garbage Collector is an application that watches the trashcan on your computer and uploads every image you throw away to the cloud. With this, we've created an online trash dump for digital images, allowing anyone to come and scavange through the dump. We're proposing a projected wall work that looks through this digital trash, allowing visitors to the conference to see the digital waste of early users of this application.

Digital waste is interesting partly because when we delete the digital manifestation of it the physical often remains on our harddrives: deleting something only removes the pointer to where it was stored in memory, allowing it to be overwritten, the physical bytes still remain in memory.

In _Living in the End Times_ Slavoj Žižek describes the properly aesthetic attitude of a radical ecologist as "not that of admiring or longing for a pristine nature of virgin forests and clear sky, but rather that of accepting waste as such, of discovering the aesthetic potential of waste, of decay, of the inertia of rotten material which serves no purpose." This project attempts to lean into this idea and give people a space to explore others digital trash, to see the aesthetic or informational potential of it, and maybe to use it to create something new.

The majority of the images we throw away are not truly images. As Rachel Ossip points out in "Ghost World," a review of Hito Steyerl’s book _Duty Free Art_, they are not "images" insofar as images are "a visual representation of something," but rather they are records, "thing[s] constituting a piece of evidence about the past." {Database of the collective unconscious or some shit??}

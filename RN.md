**Description**  

Garbage Collector is an application that watches the trashcan on your computer and uploads every image you throw away to the cloud. With this, we've created an online dump for digital images, allowing anyone to come and scavange through it. We're proposing a projected wall work that looks through this digital trash, allowing visitors to see the digital waste of early users of this application.

In _Living in the End Times_ Slavoj Žižek describes the properly aesthetic attitude of a radical ecologist as "not that of admiring or longing for a pristine nature of virgin forests and clear sky, but rather that of accepting waste as such, of discovering the aesthetic potential of waste, of decay, of the inertia of rotten material which serves no purpose." This project attempts to lean into this idea and give people a space to explore others' digital trash, to see its aesthetic or informational potential, and maybe use it to create something new.

The majority of "images" we throw away are not truly images. As Rachel Ossip points out in "Ghost World," they are not "images" insofar as images are "a visual representation of something," but rather they are records, "thing[s] constituting a piece of evidence about the past." Images that we throw away were worth storing on our computers for a time, but not forever. Maybe they were screenshots, or images we dragged from a website onto our desktops. Maybe we sent them to friends in a group chat, or debated saving them but then decided not to. Whatever the case, they are imperfect markers of something we were thinking or feeling at a given point in time. In this sense, they are a distorted portal into our unconscious: a momento of collective time.
